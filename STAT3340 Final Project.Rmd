Data Description
```{r}
options(digits = 3, scipen = 50)
library(car)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
```

# The data is read using the read.csv() function.The first six pieces of data are then displayed using the head()v function.
```{r}
df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Life Expectancy Data.csv", header=T)
head(df)
```

# Add a new variable DEVELOPED.Use the str () function to display data structure information
```{r}
df$developed <- ifelse(df$Status == "Developing", 0, 1)
str(df)
```
```{r}
write.csv(df, file = "df.csv", row.names = F)
```


# We have Country, Year, Status, developed as factor variable,
# When plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient, it is necessary to eliminate the value range of each variable among the remaining numerical variables is quite different,
# The data needs to be standardized.
```{r}
df1 <- df[, -c(1, 2, 3, 23)]
stand_scale <- preProcess(df1)
df2 <- na.omit(predict(stand_scale, df1))
head(df2)
```

# Using the cor () function to calculate the correlation coefficient matrix between the variables, the results are shown below.
```{r}
result.cor <- round(cor(df2), 2)
result.cor
```

# According to the above correlation coefficient results, variables with correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 are screened to draw a scatter plot matrix
```{r}
result.cor1 <- result.cor
result.cor1[result.cor1 < 0.7] <- "N"
result.cor1[result.cor == 1] <- "N"
result.cor1
a <- c("GDP", "Income.composition.of.resources", "Schooling",  "Life.expectancy", "percentage.expenditure", 
       "thinness..1.19.years", "thinness.5.9.years")
df3 <- df1[, a]
scatterplotMatrix(df3, spread = FALSE, smoother.args = list(lty = 2), 
                  main = "Scatter Plot Matrix")
```
Method
```{r}
Life.Expectancy.Data <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Life Expectancy Data.csv", header=T)
```
Using Backward model selection method
life expectancy is y, other 18 indictors are variables
```{r}

Lets define the alpha out equal to 0.05
summary will show the p-value for each variable.
```{r}

In table we can see the thinness..1.19.years with the largest p-vlaue and larger than alpha out, so we delete it.

In this table we can see every variables are less than alpha out vlaue and all of them are significant variables. Therefore we can get the final model y=52.4025809-0.0166069x1+0.0873726x2+0.0001801x4+0.0327984x7-0.0650677x8+ 0.0213506x9+0.0256096x11-0.4740475x12+0.0000314x13-0.0922148x16+7.4856404x17+0.8945372x18+e

In Residual vs Fittied every circles show the every single errorï¼Œthe vast majority of errors distribute around E(ei)=0, in Normall Q-Q plot we can see this final model is in accordance with normal distribution,  Scale-Location shows every variance of residual almost equal, and Residuals vs Leverage shows no abnormal points in the final model
